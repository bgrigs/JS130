// The built-in Function.prototype.bind method performs partial function application by allowing you to specify some of the function's arguments when you invoke bind. It also permanently binds the new function to a specific execution context with its first argument. That binding is, in a sense, also an example of partial function application. Here, the "argument" we're applying to the function is the function's execution context.

// Write a function that emulates the context binding aspect of bind. That is, your version of bind should merely call the function with the desired context; it doesn't need to pass any arguments to the function. Here's how you can use your function:

/*
- write a function that calls a function with a desired context
- no arguments are needed
*/

"use strict";

function bind(context, func) {
  return function() {
    func.call(context);
  }
}

let obj = {};
let boundFunc = bind(obj, function() {
  this.foo = "bar";
});

boundFunc();
console.log(obj); // { foo: 'bar' }
